# 🟢 GitHub Contribution Guide

## 🎯 Why Commits Aren't Showing as Green Squares

### The Issue
Your commits from August 6-14, 2025 are not showing as green contribution squares because:

1. **Future Dates**: GitHub doesn't recognize commits with future dates
2. **Contribution Rules**: Only commits within the last year count
3. **Email Verification**: Need to ensure email matches GitHub account

### Current Status
- ✅ **Repository Created**: Successfully on GitHub
- ✅ **24 Commits Made**: All properly recorded
- ✅ **Email Correct**: priyaakanksha393@gmail.com
- ❌ **Contribution Display**: Future dates not showing as green squares

## 🔧 Solutions to Fix Contribution Display

### Solution 1: Verify GitHub Email Settings
1. Go to **GitHub Settings** → **Emails**
2. Ensure `priyaakanksha393@gmail.com` is:
   - ✅ **Verified** (checkmark icon)
   - ✅ **Primary email**
   - ✅ **Public email** (for contribution graph)

### Solution 2: Make Current Date Commits
Let's add some commits with today's date to show contributions:

```bash
# Add a small change and commit
echo "# Updated on $(date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update documentation with current date"
git push origin main
```

### Solution 3: Check Repository Settings
1. Go to your repository: `akanksha-priya4/vehicle-registration-dashboard`
2. Check **Settings** → **General**
3. Ensure repository is **Public** (contributions show for public repos)
