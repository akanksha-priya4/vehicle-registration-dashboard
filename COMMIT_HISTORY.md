# 📅 Commit History and Contribution Tracking

## 🎯 GitHub Contribution Requirements

For commits to show up as green squares on your GitHub profile, they must meet these criteria:

1. **Author Email**: Must match your GitHub account email
2. **Commit Date**: Must be within the last year
3. **Repository**: Must be in your account (✅ Already done)
4. **Branch**: Must be on the default branch (✅ Already done)

## 📊 Current Commit Status

**Repository**: akanksha-priya4/vehicle-registration-dashboard  
**Total Commits**: 24  
**Development Period**: August 6-14, 2025  
**GitHub Email**: priyaakanksha393@gmail.com  

## 🔧 Fixing Contribution Display

### Issue Identified
The commits were created with the correct email but may not be showing as contributions due to:
- Future dates (2025) not being recognized by GitHub
- Need for proper author attribution

### Solution
We need to ensure all commits are properly attributed to your GitHub account with valid dates.

## 🚀 Next Steps

2. **Check Settings**: Go to GitHub Settings > Emails to verify
3. **Wait for Sync**: GitHub may take some time to update contribution graph
4. **Future Commits**: Any new commits will automatically show as contributions

## 📈 Contribution Graph Status

**Current Status**: Commits are recorded but may not show as green squares  
**Reason**: Future dates (2025) may not be recognized by GitHub  
**Solution**: Commits will show as contributions for current dates
